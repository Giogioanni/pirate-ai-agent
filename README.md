# CS370

For this project, I created an intelligent pirate agent that uses reinforcement learning to find its way through a maze. While I developed the Q-learning training loop, that applies the ε-greedy exploration strategy, and modified parameters like the learning rate and discount factor, the starter code supplied the maze layout, state transitions, and reward system. To be able to demonstrate how the learned policy improved, I added visualizations and made sure the agent performed movements correctly. This method showed to me how a real-world issue, such as finding treasure, can be represented as states, actions, and rewards before being resolved through the methodical design of algorithms. This project helped me understand how computer science involves problem modeling, solution testing, and iterative improvement. I also noticed the value of taking a step-by-step approach to problems, like modeling, testing, debugging, and improvement. This project also reaffirmed that developing intelligent systems involves ethical obligations, such as maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and fairness while avoiding exaggerating the system's capabilities. In spite of being a small project, I think it still demonstrated how crucial it is for computer scientists to strike a balance between responsible design that safeguards end users and fosters trust and technical solutions.
